## Details

**Audio Stimuli**: 
* natural stimuli, i.e. animal vocalizations, environmental sounds, etc.
* 7.5 - 15 s long on average
* covered freqs from 0 to 22 kHz
* 3 to 63 presented sound clips, depending on neurons

**Neural Responses**
* Sprague Dawley rats
* 25 neurons, of which 3 are unresponsive, and 1 has too few data.
* membrane potentials obtained in patch-clamp (current-clamp mode, I=0)
* pharmacologically blocked action potentials


## Setup

**Requirements**: A CRCNS account to download the dataset, MATLAB to preprocess it.
